Muer is a joke site aims at collecting best jokes from all types of websites and gathering people all around the world to vote, appreciate, and contribute to this joke pool.

The site is developed in django web framework. Joke resource is scraped from internet using BeautifulSoup, a python html parsing tool.

I'm open sourcing this repo in hope of all joke enthusiastics will collaborate with each other and make this web based joke application an fun, efficient place to get the joke people enjoy.
